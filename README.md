# Basic Portfolio 

### Overview

My basic portfolio is the first website that I built. It was built with HTML and CSS and does not use bootstrap or other libraries.

The project has 3 pages - a home/index page, a contact page and a portfolio page. The portfolio page does not have links to projects I have done as it was just a sample as a first project.
